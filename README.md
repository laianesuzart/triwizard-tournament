## about

This project was originally built using React class components and later refactored into functional components.
Most recently, it was updated to be fully responsive for mobile devices and to take advantage of modern CSS features such as nested rules and the :is() selector.

It also marks the first time I‚Äôve used:

- the Browser Dialog API (for modal interactions)
- the GSAP library (for smooth and dynamic animations)

‚òùÔ∏è Not a Harry Potter character, but do you recognize him? That‚Äôs Mashle!
The anime is pretty fun ‚Äî highly recommended if you like a mix of comedy and magic ‚ö°
